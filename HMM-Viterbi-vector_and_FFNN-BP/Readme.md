# Part 1

Given a sequence of words, produce the POS tag sequence 
Technique to be used: HMM-Viterbi-vector (vector based; the whole corpus is corpus of word vectors which replace words)
Use Universal Tag Set (12 in number);
<ADJ, ADP, ., NOUN, CONJ, NUM, PRT, ADV, X, VERB, PRON, DET>
5-fold cross validation
Compare with HMM-Viterbi-symbolic 

# Part 2

Given a sequence of words, produce the POS tag sequence
Technique to be used: word2vec vectors, FFNN and BP (a slide on FFNN-BP architecture is a must)
Use Universal Tag Set (12 in number);
<ADJ, ADP, ., NOUN, CONJ, NUM, PRT, ADV, X, VERB, PRON, DET>
5-fold cross validation
Compare with HMM-Viterbi-symbolic
