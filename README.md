# POS_tagging

Here I have implemented and compared three methods of POS tagging, namely:  
1. Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
2. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using Viterbi vector
3. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) with Backpropogation (BP)

Below are the overall results:

A detailed analysis of models can be found in Readme files in given folders
